        <h2>The case</h2>
        <p>Willys.se have a new business goal, they want to be the best selling grocery online shop in Sweden for students 20-30 year.<br><br>Willys have asked our team to help them to reach their goal. Our mission is to make research about the user experience on Willys.se. We want to find usability problems and improvements. Our goal is to make willys.se more suitable for young students, meet their goals, needs, behavior and make them more satisfied with their experience on Willys.se.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="right">
        <h2>The project</h2>
        <p>This project focusing on different research methods for UX design. This work was executed in 4 stages.
          <ol>
            <li>Created a persona based on surveys and interviews we executed.</li>
            <li>Created scenarios based on our personas needs and goals with metric methods and demands.</li>
            <li>Prepared and performed usability test.</li>
            <li>Analyzed the result.</li>

        <h2>Surveys</h2>
        <p>We started the process with a look back at our previous surveys we made for creating personas and took lessons from what we did then. What questions could we use again and what kind of questions do we need to rephrase because we didn't get exactly the data we were looking for? What more data do we need to be able to create a persona for Willys, a 20-30 year old student? The survey was made in Google forms because it is so easy and quick to create and send out to people within the target group.<br><br>The goal with the survey was to mainly collect quantitative data for our persona. We got 18 answers on the survey, then we exported the data to Excel.<br><br>We started to analyze the responders' answers, we color-coded that raw data along the bottom-up method, then we coded themes of the codes. We used the bottom-up method because we already know what kind of answer we were looking for. We created type value, mean value and median for each question as a result.</p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <p>We discussed the data we get from the surveys and what kind of questions we would like to dig deeper in for our upcoming interviews. We asked ourself what more information we need to get about our persona? The goal with the interviews was to mainly collect qualitative data.<br><br>We prepared an interview mall for our semi structured interview. We made one interview each and the interviews was conducted across Google meet and recorded.<br><br><strong>We asked questions like:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>How would you describe yourself with one sentence?</li>
            <li>How do you usually buy groceries?</li>
            <li>Have you ever bought groceries online before?</li>
            <li>What made you try shopping for groceries online the first time?</li>
            <li>What are your reasons for buying groceries online?</li>
            <li>How have your experiences been with shopping online?</li>
            <li>Have you been through any disturbing moments when shopping for food online and what?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When the interviews were done we transcribed and coded the raw data in the same way as we did for the surveys. It was good to be able to go through the recorded intervju again. I was more able to reflect on the answer then during the intervju, because I was so focused on the moderator role during the intervju.</p>

      <h2>Persona</h2>
      <p>We look through our summarized analyzed data from both the surveys and the interviews. Ensure that we have all the information we need about characteristics like needs, motivations, goals and frustrations. We create our persona in Figma based on our data.<br><br>Then we went through with our persona, we wanted to take out the 3 most important points. Then we saw that some things didn't agree with our personas character. For example, she is a structured person and her shopping behavior is spontaneous. We had to go through the data and persona again and make some small adjustments to make the persona more uniform.</p>

    <h2>What do we need to test?</h2>
    <p>Next step in this project was to find out what we need to test and measure on a usability test based on our persona.<br><br>The goal is to find usability problems and develop a better user experience on Willys.se, to be able to reach Willys goal.<br><br>We question ourselves: “What are the most important things that our persona will be able to accomplish on the site?”<br><br>We create 3 main needs for our persona. Then we expand the needs with goals and scenarios with the method as you see in the next picture. This resulted in 3 scenarios for our coming usability test. I think this methode worked great to create reasonable scenarious for the usability on Willys.se.<br><br>I now think in retrospect that we should add a part in our interviews that would be about how we could get students more interested in shopping groceries online and what we should do to make them more interested to use Willys.se.</p>

    <h2>Which metric method will we use?</h2>
    <p>To decide the associated usability metric methods for each scenario we discussed a lot about Whitney's 5Es theori. We question ourselves: “What will we measure during the scenarios to meet our personas need and expectation?”<br><br>Our persona is not so common online grocery shopper and according to Whiteny we should investigate all the E but focusing on Easy to learn, Engaging and Error tolerant.<br><br>The goal with using Whiteny´s 5 E's as a method, it helps us visualize the balance of the five dimensions of usability needs. We laboraded with different kinds of metric methods for the scenario until we got a good balance for all the dimensions of usability needs. This method really helped us during this process to make sure we tested all the dimensions of the user experiences. Otherwise I think we would easily forget some dimension that we thought was obvious but maybe not for the users.</p>

    <h2>Usability test</h2>
    <p>For the usability tests we recruited 4 participants. We prepared a recruitment letter, task description with the scenarios and links to the surveys, moderators checklist and manus for moderator.<br><br>We made a pilot to evaluate our prepared material for the usability test. I also filmed myself at the same time to make sure how my body language looks and communicates. Important to be self-conscious about it for the real usability test, I don't want to influence our participants which can affect the results.<br><br>The usability tests conducted over Google meets with one moderator and 1 person in the team took notes. We asked our participants to think out loud then they executed the tasks. We filmed the tests with OBS Studio that made it possible for the moderator to go back and take notes according to our metric methods. Our mistake was that the annotare just had one screen so it was hard to both take notes and see the participant. <br><br>Then we started to analyze the raw data we splitted the qualitative and quantitative data according to our metric method and requirements. After that we started to fill our table we created according to the book Usability testing essentials: ready, set…test! av Barnrum, C. (2011). We picked a lot of information and tips for that book during this project.<br><br>We analyzed our data and concluded some positive and negative findings.<br><br><strong>Positive findings:​</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easily and quickly navigated around on the website.</li>
      <li>The search function on the landing page was easy for the participant to quickly find the groceries they wanted.</li>
      <li>Comparison price for each product was easy to see. Appreciated by our target group as a student with a tight budget.</li>
    </ul>
‍       <p><strong>Negative findings:​</strong><p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unsure about the unit then added bananas to the chart.</li>
      <li>Unclear error message then participant searching address for delivery on the landing page.</li>
      <li>Unclear information about sold out groceries and replacement products.</li>
      <li>Information about time of delivery and price.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design solution</h2>
    <p>Based on our research we found some usability problems, we created some design solutions for improving these usability problems. Below you see one of our improvements.<br><br><strong>‍The problem:</strong> Sometimes products were missing in the delivery with unclear information to the user.<br><br><strong>Our design improvements :</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Removed the checkbox with unclear text about replacement products in the shopping cart. It was placed above the product in the cart, more logical to have that kind of choice then you are done with your cart and want to proceed.</li>
      <li>We added a new function for choosing replacement products when a product is out of stock. When the user proceeds from the cart to the payment, if any of the products in the cart is out of stock, it will pop-up a box with information about which product is out of stock and there will be options for similar products that the user can add to their cart.
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Our argument for this design solution:</strong><p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user doesn't miss the information about missing products because of the pop-up.</li>
      <li>The pop-up offers the user to choose which product they will add as a replacement product. This is important then our persona is conscious about the price and quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <p>This school project was very instructive about UX research. To thoroughly get through the details and different methods of research to find usability problems and improvement.<br><br>To record myself before the real interview was so great to be more self conscious about my own body language and what I should think about during the real interview and usability test. As a moderator, it is important to avoid affecting the participant that could lead to inaccurate results. I also said a lot of hm in the recording, and that is not professional in the interview which I had to exercise before and thought about during the intervju.<br><br>During my intervju, the participant got stock in one of our tasks. It was artful how not to help the participant but in the same way make the participant complete the task. The participant was quick in her actions which made it difficult for me, because I needed to act fast because she started to doubt herself and I did not want her to feel worthless or give up the task. I wasn't prepared for the think-fast action, in the end she solved the task but she didn't reach our goal.​</p>
  </div>
  <div id="right">
    <p class="margin">Our metrics methods and demands were not really well thought out for some of our tasks. That made some goals unreachable. One of the scenarios was not formulated clearly enough, which made our participant not understand that the task was clocked. I will keep this in mind for my upcoming usability tests.<br><br>I think we miss one part of our research: How to make our target group more interested about online groceries shopping? How do we get our target group to try Willys.se?<br><br>We should add some questions about this in an interview I think.<br><br>Our new design solution is not user tested. If we would go further with this project we should make new user tests on our design suggestions.</p>
